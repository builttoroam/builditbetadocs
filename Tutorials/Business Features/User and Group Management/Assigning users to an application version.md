<h2>How to assign users to an application version</h2>
As an account owner of an application, you can restrict access to an application version by assigning only the users or groups you want. Be default all users associated with an application can see all versions. To restrict access to a version for users you will need to assign access (below) and uncheck **Users can see all app versions** see [**Configuring application deployment and feedback**](http://build-it-beta-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Business%20Features/Configuring%20application%20deployment%20and%20feedback/)

4. Click on a user that you want to assign access to this version of the application. Click on a group to assign access to all members that are a part of that group. When you click on a user or group their background header will turn green. (**Note** - you can't unassign an account owner as account owners can see all versions of an application by design)<br><br>
