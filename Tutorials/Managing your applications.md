## Email your file to upload@builditbeta.com ##
Once you have registered your email with Build it Beta (see **Getting Started**) you can upload your file to **upload@builditbeta.com**

1. Create a new email (from the registered email account)

1. Attach your file (.xap or .appx) to the email

		Setup Instructions
		If this is the first time you've used Build it Beta follow these instructions to setup your Windows or Windows Phone device for testing using Build it Beta
		Build it Beta uses the enterprise sideloading capability available in both Windows and Windows Phone in order to deploy pre-release versions of applications.
		
		
		This will only work on Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8 and above. In order for this to work you must first install the Built to Roam enterprise deployment certificate - this allows for applications signed using this certificate to be installed on your device. The Build it Beta Installer application needs to also be installed in order to download and install application versions from the Build it Beta service
		Minor changes are made to the applications to restrict use for testing purposes only (expiry period) and to allow for feedback to be captured from within the application (swipe down from the top of the app to reveal feedback pane).
