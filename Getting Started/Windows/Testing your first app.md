1. Using the same email address that you registered with Build it Beta, you can now send a .xap (windows phone 8) or .appx file (windows phone 8.1) from your registered email account to <b>upload@builditbeta.com</b>. <p><small><b>(Example: if a user registered with testaccount@outlook.com, then the .xap, or .appx file would then be sent to 'upload@builditbeta.com' from testaccount@outlook.com - There are other ways to upload files to Build it Beta, but for this example we are uploading to Build it Beta using email)</b></small></p>
1. Your app will be sent off to Build it Beta and will appear as a new app inside Build it Beta (the time it takes for Build it Beta to register your app will be determined by the file size of your app). If you have turned on notifications from Build it Beta, you will recieve a small notification that your app is now ready for testing
