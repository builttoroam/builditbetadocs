<h2>Build it Beta definitions</h2>
##A##

- **Accounts** - An Account, or **Billing Account** is a container for **purchases, users** and **applications**. An account can either be valid or expired. If an Account is expired, and you are the **Account Owner**, an **Expired** message bar will appear at the top of the application to indicate the account needs to be updated. To fix an expired account, purchase subscriptions for more testers or applications.


- **Account Owner** - An account owner is someone who has access to modify users and applications associated with an account. An Account can have one or more owners. As an account owner you have additional access to configure features of an application. You can also add and remove other users as account owners of an account.


- **Application** - An Application can have one or more versions associated with it. Build it Beta installs a version of an application even if only one version exists, the single version will be installed on your device.

- **Assigned Access** - Is a feature reserved for valid account owners. Assigning access is the ability to restrict version visibility by unchecking **Users can view all app versions** in the configuration settings for an application. If a **users** is not assigned to an application version, and **Users can view all app versions** is unchecked in the application configuration, then the user will only be able to see versions they have been assigned to
